# Judgment Fleet Website

This is the codebase for the Judgment Fleet website, an Elite Pok√©mon Tournament Team website.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with a clear separation between frontend and backend code:

### Frontend Structure

- `/src/frontend/components`: UI components
- `/src/frontend/contexts`: React context providers
- `/src/frontend/hooks`: Custom React hooks
- `/src/frontend/pages`: Page components
- `/src/frontend/types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/frontend/utils`: Utility functions

### Backend Structure

- `/src/backend/api`: API endpoints and services
  - `auth.ts`: Authentication services
  - `faqs.ts`: FAQ management
  - `games.ts`: Game management
  - `members.ts`: Member management
  - `index.ts`: API exports

### Shared Resources

- `/src/components`: Shared UI components (used by both frontend and backend)
- `/src/hooks`: Shared custom hooks
- `/src/integrations`: External service integrations (Supabase, etc.)
- `/src/lib`: Utility libraries and helpers
- `/src/locales`: Internationalization files

## API Structure

The API is organized into domain-specific modules:

- `authApi`: Authentication services
- `faqsApi`: FAQ management
- `gamesApi`: Game management 
- `membersApi`: Member management

Each API module follows a consistent pattern with methods for:
- `getAll`: Fetch all records
- `getById`: Fetch a single record by ID
- `create`: Create a new record
- `update`: Update an existing record
- `delete`: Delete a record
- And other specialized methods as needed

## Data Models

Key data models include:

- `Member`: Team member information
- `Game`: Best games showcase
- `FAQ`: Frequently asked questions
- `User`: Authentication user data

## Authentication

Authentication is handled through Supabase Auth, with admin role management for the admin dashboard.

## Database

The application uses Supabase as its database backend with tables for:
- `members`
- `best_games`
- `faqs`
- `admins`
- `footer_resources`
